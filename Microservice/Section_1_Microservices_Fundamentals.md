# Section 1 â€“ Microservices Fundamentals

## 1.1 What are Microservices

Microservices are an architectural approach to building software applications as a collection of small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. Each service is designed around a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service focuses on one business function
- **Independence**: Services can be developed and deployed independently
- **Decentralized**: No central database or shared state
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system
- **Technology Diversity**: Each service can use different technologies

### Real-World Analogy:
Think of a restaurant kitchen where each station (grill, salad, dessert, drinks) operates independently but coordinates to serve a complete meal. Each station has its own tools, ingredients, and processes, but they communicate to ensure the final dish is delivered properly.

### Example in Java:
```java
// User Service - handles user management
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {
    @Autowired
    private UserService userService;
    
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<User> getUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok(userService.findById(id));
    }
}

// Order Service - handles order management
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/orders")
public class OrderController {
    @Autowired
    private OrderService orderService;
    
    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<Order> createOrder(@RequestBody OrderRequest request) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok(orderService.createOrder(request));
    }
}
```

## 1.2 Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture

A monolithic architecture is a traditional approach where the entire application is built as a single, unified unit. All components are tightly coupled and deployed together.

### Monolithic Architecture:
- **Single Codebase**: All functionality in one application
- **Shared Database**: One database for all features
- **Deployment Unit**: Entire application deployed as one unit
- **Technology Stack**: Single technology stack for entire application
- **Scaling**: Scale entire application together

### Microservices Architecture:
- **Multiple Codebases**: Each service has its own codebase
- **Database per Service**: Each service has its own database
- **Independent Deployment**: Each service can be deployed independently
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use different technologies
- **Granular Scaling**: Scale individual services based on demand

### Comparison Table:

| Aspect | Monolithic | Microservices |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Development** | Single team, single codebase | Multiple teams, multiple codebases |
| **Deployment** | Deploy entire application | Deploy individual services |
| **Scaling** | Scale entire application | Scale individual services |
| **Technology** | Single technology stack | Multiple technology stacks |
| **Database** | Shared database | Database per service |
| **Testing** | Test entire application | Test individual services |
| **Debugging** | Easier to debug | More complex debugging |

### Example - E-commerce Application:

**Monolithic Approach:**
```java
// All in one application
@SpringBootApplication
public class EcommerceApplication {
    // User management
    // Product catalog
    // Order processing
    // Payment processing
    // Inventory management
    // All in one codebase
}
```

**Microservices Approach:**
```java
// User Service
@SpringBootApplication
public class UserServiceApplication {
    // Only user management functionality
}

// Product Service
@SpringBootApplication
public class ProductServiceApplication {
    // Only product catalog functionality
}

// Order Service
@SpringBootApplication
public class OrderServiceApplication {
    // Only order processing functionality
}
```

## 1.3 Microservices vs SOA

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural pattern that focuses on creating reusable services that can be composed to build applications. While similar to microservices, there are key differences.

### SOA Characteristics:
- **Enterprise Focus**: Designed for enterprise-wide service reuse
- **ESB (Enterprise Service Bus)**: Central communication hub
- **Service Reusability**: Services designed for maximum reuse
- **Technology Agnostic**: Services can use different technologies
- **Governance**: Heavy governance and standardization

### Microservices Characteristics:
- **Application Focus**: Designed for specific application needs
- **Direct Communication**: Services communicate directly
- **Service Specificity**: Services designed for specific business capabilities
- **Technology Diversity**: Encourages different technologies
- **Lightweight Governance**: Minimal governance overhead

### Key Differences:

| Aspect | SOA | Microservices |
|--------|-----|---------------|
| **Scope** | Enterprise-wide | Application-specific |
| **Communication** | ESB-mediated | Direct service-to-service |
| **Service Size** | Large, coarse-grained | Small, fine-grained |
| **Data** | Shared data models | Database per service |
| **Governance** | Heavy governance | Lightweight governance |
| **Technology** | Technology-agnostic | Technology diversity encouraged |

### Example - SOA vs Microservices:

**SOA Approach:**
```java
// Enterprise Service Bus mediates communication
@Service
public class OrderProcessingService {
    @Autowired
    private ESBClient esbClient;
    
    public Order processOrder(OrderRequest request) {
        // Communicate through ESB
        User user = esbClient.callService("UserService", "getUser", request.getUserId());
        Product product = esbClient.callService("ProductService", "getProduct", request.getProductId());
        // Process order
        return new Order(user, product, request.getQuantity());
    }
}
```

**Microservices Approach:**
```java
// Direct service-to-service communication
@Service
public class OrderService {
    @Autowired
    private UserServiceClient userServiceClient;
    
    @Autowired
    private ProductServiceClient productServiceClient;
    
    public Order processOrder(OrderRequest request) {
        // Direct HTTP calls to other services
        User user = userServiceClient.getUser(request.getUserId());
        Product product = productServiceClient.getProduct(request.getProductId());
        // Process order
        return new Order(user, product, request.getQuantity());
    }
}
```

public class SimpleBlogApplication {
    // User management
    // Post management
    // Comment management
    // All simple CRUD operations
    // Single team, single technology
}

// Complex e-commerce platform - Use Microservices
@SpringBootApplication
public class UserServiceApplication {
    // Complex user management with multiple integrations
}

@SpringBootApplication
public class ProductServiceApplication {
    // Complex product catalog with search, recommendations
}

@SpringBootApplication
public class OrderServiceApplication {
    // Complex order processing with multiple payment methods
}
```

## 1.6 Microservices Design Principles

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
Each service should have one reason to change and one business capability.

```java
// Good: Single responsibility
@Service
public class UserService {
    public User createUser(UserRequest request) {
        // Only handles user creation
    }
    
    public User updateUser(Long id, UserRequest request) {
        // Only handles user updates
    }
}

// Bad: Multiple responsibilities
@Service
public class UserOrderService {
    public User createUser(UserRequest request) {
        // User management
    }
    
    public Order createOrder(OrderRequest request) {
        // Order management - should be separate service
    }
}
```

### 2. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
Services should be organized around business domains, not technical layers.

```java
// Good: Domain-driven
@Service
public class CustomerService {
    // Customer domain - user management, profiles, preferences
}

@Service
public class OrderService {
    // Order domain - order creation, processing, fulfillment
}

// Bad: Technical layers
@Service
public class DatabaseService {
    // Technical layer - should be organized by domain
}
```

### 3. **Database per Service**
Each service should have its own database to ensure data independence.

```java
// Good: Database per service
@SpringBootApplication
public class UserServiceApplication {
    @Bean
    public DataSource userDataSource() {
        // User service database
        return DataSourceBuilder.create()
            .url("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/user_db")
            .build();
    }
}

@SpringBootApplication
public class OrderServiceApplication {
    @Bean
    public DataSource orderDataSource() {
        // Order service database
        return DataSourceBuilder.create()
            .url("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/order_db")
            .build();
    }
}
```

### 4. **Decentralized Governance**
Each service team should have autonomy over their service's technology choices.

```java
// User Service - Java with Spring Boot
@SpringBootApplication
public class UserServiceApplication {
    // Java/Spring Boot implementation
}

// Analytics Service - Python with Flask
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/analytics')
def get_analytics():
    # Python/Flask implementation
    pass
```

### 5. **Fault Tolerance**
Services should be designed to handle failures gracefully.

```java
@Service
public class OrderService {
    @Autowired
    private UserServiceClient userServiceClient;
    
    @Autowired
    private ProductServiceClient productServiceClient;
    
    public Order createOrder(OrderRequest request) {
        try {
            User user = userServiceClient.getUser(request.getUserId());
            Product product = productServiceClient.getProduct(request.getProductId());
            return new Order(user, product, request.getQuantity());
        } catch (UserServiceException e) {
            // Handle user service failure
            throw new OrderCreationException("User service unavailable", e);
        } catch (ProductServiceException e) {
            // Handle product service failure
            throw new OrderCreationException("Product service unavailable", e);
        }
    }
}
```

### 6. **Observability**
Services should be designed for monitoring and debugging.

```java
@RestController
public class OrderController {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(OrderController.class);
    
    @PostMapping("/orders")
    public ResponseEntity<Order> createOrder(@RequestBody OrderRequest request) {
        logger.info("Creating order for user: {}", request.getUserId());
        
        try {
            Order order = orderService.createOrder(request);
            logger.info("Order created successfully: {}", order.getId());
            return ResponseEntity.ok(order);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            logger.error("Failed to create order for user: {}", request.getUserId(), e);
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).build();
        }
    }
}
```

## 1.7 Domain-Driven Design for Microservices

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that focuses on creating a model of the business domain and organizing code around that model.

### Key DDD Concepts:

#### 1. **Domain**
The business area or subject matter that the software addresses.

#### 2. **Bounded Context**
A boundary within which a domain model is valid and consistent.

#### 3. **Aggregate**
A cluster of domain objects that are treated as a single unit.

#### 4. **Entity**
An object that has a distinct identity.

#### 5. **Value Object**
An object that is defined by its attributes rather than identity.

### DDD in Microservices:

```java
// User Domain - User Service
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String email;
    private String name;
    private UserProfile profile;
    
    // User domain logic
    public void updateProfile(UserProfile newProfile) {
        this.profile = newProfile;
    }
}

// Order Domain - Order Service
@Entity
public class Order {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private Long userId;
    private List<OrderItem> items;
    private OrderStatus status;
    
    // Order domain logic
    public void addItem(Product product, int quantity) {
        items.add(new OrderItem(product, quantity));
    }
}

// Product Domain - Product Service
@Entity
public class Product {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private BigDecimal price;
    private ProductCategory category;
    
    // Product domain logic
    public boolean isAvailable() {
        return price != null && price.compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) > 0;
    }
}
```

### Bounded Contexts:

```java
// User Management Context
@Service
public class UserService {
    // Handles user registration, authentication, profile management
    public User registerUser(UserRegistrationRequest request) {
        // User-specific business logic
    }
}

// Order Processing Context
@Service
public class OrderService {
    // Handles order creation, processing, fulfillment
    public Order createOrder(OrderRequest request) {
        // Order-specific business logic
    }
}

// Product Catalog Context
@Service
public class ProductService {
    // Handles product management, catalog, search
    public Product createProduct(ProductRequest request) {
        // Product-specific business logic
    }
}
```

## 1.8 Bounded Contexts in Microservices

A bounded context is a boundary within which a domain model is valid and consistent. In microservices, each service typically represents one bounded context.

### Characteristics of Bounded Contexts:

#### 1. **Clear Boundaries**
Each context has well-defined boundaries and responsibilities.

#### 2. **Independent Models**
Each context can have its own domain model and terminology.

#### 3. **Minimal Dependencies**
Contexts should have minimal dependencies on each other.

#### 4. **Consistent Within Context**
The model is consistent within the context but may differ across contexts.

### Example - E-commerce Bounded Contexts:

```java
// User Management Context
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String email;
    private String name;
    private UserProfile profile;
    
    // User-specific business logic
    public boolean isActive() {
        return profile != null && profile.isActive();
    }
}

// Order Management Context
@Entity
public class Order {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private Long userId; // Reference to user, not full user object
    private List<OrderItem> items;
    private OrderStatus status;
    
    // Order-specific business logic
    public BigDecimal calculateTotal() {
        return items.stream()
            .map(OrderItem::getSubtotal)
            .reduce(BigDecimal.ZERO, BigDecimal::add);
    }
}

// Product Catalog Context
@Entity
public class Product {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private BigDecimal price;
    private ProductCategory category;
    
    // Product-specific business logic
    public boolean isInStock() {
        return category != null && category.isAvailable();
    }
}
```

### Context Mapping:

```java
// Context Map showing relationships between bounded contexts
public class ContextMap {
    // User Context -> Order Context (Customer relationship)
    public class UserOrderRelationship {
        // User provides customer information to Order
        // Order references User by ID
    }
    
    // Product Context -> Order Context (Product relationship)
    public class ProductOrderRelationship {
        // Product provides product information to Order
        // Order references Product by ID
    }
    
    // Order Context -> Payment Context (Payment relationship)
    public class OrderPaymentRelationship {
        // Order initiates payment process
        // Payment references Order by ID
    }
}
```

### Anti-Corruption Layer:

```java
// Anti-corruption layer between User Context and Order Context
@Service
public class UserOrderAdapter {
    @Autowired
    private UserServiceClient userServiceClient;
    
    public CustomerInfo getCustomerInfo(Long userId) {
        User user = userServiceClient.getUser(userId);
        
        // Transform user domain model to order domain model
        return CustomerInfo.builder()
            .userId(user.getId())
            .email(user.getEmail())
            .name(user.getName())
            .build();
    }
}
```
