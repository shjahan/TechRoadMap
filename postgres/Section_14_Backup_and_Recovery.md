# Section 14 â€“ Backup and Recovery

## 14.1 Backup Strategies

PostgreSQL provides multiple backup strategies for different recovery requirements.

### Backup Types:
- **Logical Backups**: pg_dump and pg_dumpall
- **Physical Backups**: File system level backups
- **Continuous Archiving**: WAL-based backups
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Recovery to specific points
- **Incremental Backups**: Only changed data

### Real-World Analogy:
Backup strategies are like different ways to preserve important documents:
- **Logical Backups** = Making photocopies of documents
- **Physical Backups** = Copying entire filing cabinets
- **Continuous Archiving** = Keeping change logs
- **Point-in-Time Recovery** = Restoring to specific dates
- **Incremental Backups** = Only copying new documents

### SQL Example - Backup Strategies:
```sql
-- Check backup configuration
SELECT 
    name,
    setting,
    unit,
    context,
    short_desc
FROM pg_settings 
WHERE name IN (
    'wal_level',
    'archive_mode',
    'archive_command',
    'restore_command',
    'max_wal_size',
    'min_wal_size'
);

-- Check WAL level
SHOW wal_level;

-- Check archive mode
SHOW archive_mode;

-- Check archive command
SHOW archive_command;

-- Check restore command
SHOW restore_command;

-- Check WAL size settings
SHOW max_wal_size;
SHOW min_wal_size;

-- Check current WAL position
SELECT pg_current_wal_lsn();

-- Check WAL files
SELECT 
    name,
    size,
    modification
FROM pg_ls_waldir()
ORDER BY modification DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check WAL statistics
SELECT 
    wal_records,
    wal_fpi,
    wal_bytes,
    wal_buffers_full,
    wal_write,
    wal_sync,
    wal_write_time,
    wal_sync_time
FROM pg_stat_wal;

-- Check backup status
SELECT 
    pg_is_in_backup(),
    pg_backup_start_time(),
    pg_backup_stop_time();
```

## 14.2 pg_dump and pg_restore

pg_dump and pg_restore provide logical backup and restore capabilities.

### pg_dump Features:
- **Database Dumps**: Complete database backups
- **Schema Dumps**: Schema-only backups
- **Data Dumps**: Data-only backups
- **Custom Format**: Compressed and efficient format
- **Parallel Dumps**: Parallel backup processing

### Real-World Analogy:
pg_dump is like creating a detailed inventory of a library:
- **Database Dumps** = Complete library catalog
- **Schema Dumps** = Library structure only
- **Data Dumps** = Book contents only
- **Custom Format** = Compressed catalog
- **Parallel Dumps** = Multiple librarians working

### SQL Example - pg_dump and pg_restore:
```sql
-- Check database size
SELECT 
    datname,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(datname)) as size
FROM pg_database
WHERE datname = current_database();

-- Check table sizes
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;

-- Check index sizes
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexname::regclass)) as size
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexname::regclass) DESC;

-- Check sequence sizes
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    sequencename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||sequencename)) as size
FROM pg_sequences
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||sequencename) DESC;

-- Check function sizes
SELECT 
    n.nspname as schema_name,
    p.proname as function_name,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(p.oid)) as size
FROM pg_proc p
JOIN pg_namespace n ON p.pronamespace = n.oid
WHERE n.nspname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(p.oid) DESC;

-- Check view sizes
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    viewname,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||viewname)) as size
FROM pg_views
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||viewname) DESC;
```

## 14.3 Physical Backups

Physical backups copy database files at the file system level.

### Physical Backup Features:

    name,
    size,
    modification
FROM pg_ls_waldir()
ORDER BY modification DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check WAL configuration
SELECT 
    name,
    setting,

### Real-World Analogy:
Continuous archiving is like keeping detailed change logs:
- **WAL Archiving** = Saving change logs
- **Archive Command** = How to save logs
- **Restore Command** = How to restore logs
- **Recovery Target** = Which point to restore to
- **Recovery Testing** = Testing restoration

### SQL Example - Continuous Archiving:
```sql

### PITR Features:
- **Recovery Target**: Specify recovery points
- **Recovery Commands**: Recovery configuration
- **WAL Replay**: Replay WAL files

- **Recovery Commands** = How to rewind
- **WAL Replay** = Replaying events
- **Recovery Testing** = Testing the rewind
- **Recovery Monitoring** = Watching the process

### SQL Example - Point-in-Time Recovery:
```sql

    unit,
    context,
    short_desc
FROM pg_settings 
WHERE name IN (
    'recovery_target_time',
