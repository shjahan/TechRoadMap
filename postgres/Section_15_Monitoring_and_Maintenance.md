# Section 15 â€“ Monitoring and Maintenance

## 15.1 PostgreSQL Monitoring Tools

PostgreSQL provides comprehensive monitoring tools for database administration.

### Monitoring Tools:
- **System Catalogs**: Built-in monitoring views
- **Statistics Views**: Performance statistics
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging system
- **External Tools**: Third-party monitoring tools
- **Custom Monitoring**: Custom monitoring solutions

### Real-World Analogy:
Monitoring tools are like having a dashboard in a car:
- **System Catalogs** = Built-in gauges
- **Statistics Views** = Performance meters
- **Logging** = Trip recorder
- **External Tools** = GPS and navigation
- **Custom Monitoring** = Custom dashboard

### SQL Example - Monitoring Tools:
```sql
-- Check database statistics
SELECT 
    datname,
    numbackends,
    xact_commit,
    xact_rollback,
    blks_read,
    blks_hit,
    100.0 * blks_hit / (blks_hit + blks_read) AS hit_percent,
    tup_returned,
    tup_fetched,
    tup_inserted,
    tup_updated,
    tup_deleted
FROM pg_stat_database
WHERE datname = current_database();

-- Check table statistics
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    n_tup_ins,
    n_tup_upd,
    n_tup_del,
    n_live_tup,
    n_dead_tup,
    n_mod_since_analyze,
    last_vacuum,
    last_autovacuum,
    last_analyze,
    last_autoanalyze
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY n_live_tup DESC;

-- Check index statistics
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_read,
    idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

SELECT 
    schemaname,
    funcname,
    calls,
    total_time,
    mean_time,
    stddev_time
FROM pg_stat_user_functions
ORDER BY total_time DESC;

-- Check connection statistics
SELECT 
    state,
    COUNT(*) as connection_count
FROM pg_stat_activity
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY connection_count DESC;
```

## 15.2 System Catalogs and Views

PostgreSQL system catalogs provide detailed information about database objects.

### System Catalogs:
- **pg_class**: Tables, indexes, sequences
- **pg_namespace**: Schemas
- **pg_attribute**: Table columns
- **pg_index**: Index information
- **pg_constraint**: Constraints

### Real-World Analogy:
System catalogs are like a detailed building directory:
- **pg_class** = Room listings
- **pg_namespace** = Floor plans
- **pg_attribute** = Room details
- **pg_index** = Room indexes
- **pg_constraint** = Building rules

### SQL Example - System Catalogs:
```sql
-- Check table information
SELECT 
    c.relname as table_name,
    n.nspname as schema_name,
    c.relkind,
    c.reltuples,
    c.relpages,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(c.oid)) as size
FROM pg_class c
JOIN pg_namespace n ON c.relnamespace = n.oid
WHERE c.relkind = 'r'
AND n.nspname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(c.oid) DESC;

-- Check index information
SELECT 
    c.relname as index_name,
    n.nspname as schema_name,
    t.relname as table_name,
    c.relkind,
    c.reltuples,
    c.relpages,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(c.oid)) as size
FROM pg_class c
JOIN pg_namespace n ON c.relnamespace = n.oid
JOIN pg_index i ON c.oid = i.indexrelid
JOIN pg_class t ON i.indrelid = t.oid
WHERE c.relkind = 'i'
AND n.nspname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(c.oid) DESC;

-- Check column information
SELECT 
    c.relname as table_name,
    n.nspname as schema_name,
    a.attname as column_name,
    a.attnum as column_number,
    t.typname as data_type,
    a.attnotnull as not_null,
    a.atthasdef as has_default
FROM pg_class c
JOIN pg_namespace n ON c.relnamespace = n.oid
JOIN pg_attribute a ON c.oid = a.attrelid
JOIN pg_type t ON a.atttypid = t.oid
WHERE c.relkind = 'r'
AND n.nspname = 'public'
AND a.attnum > 0
ORDER BY c.relname, a.attnum;

-- Check constraint information
SELECT 
    c.conname as constraint_name,
    c.contype as constraint_type,
    t.relname as table_name,
    n.nspname as schema_name
FROM pg_constraint c
JOIN pg_class t ON c.conrelid = t.oid
JOIN pg_namespace n ON t.relnamespace = n.oid
WHERE n.nspname = 'public'
ORDER BY t.relname, c.conname;
```

## 15.3 Performance Monitoring

Performance monitoring tracks database performance metrics.

### Performance Metrics:
- **Query Performance**: Query execution times
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, I/O usage
- **Connection Metrics**: Connection counts and states
- **Lock Metrics**: Lock contention and waits

### Real-World Analogy:
Performance monitoring is like monitoring a factory:
- **Query Performance** = Production line speed
- **Resource Usage** = Machine utilization
- **Connection Metrics** = Worker count
- **Lock Metrics** = Production bottlenecks
- **Cache Metrics** = Inventory efficiency

### SQL Example - Performance Monitoring:
```sql
-- Check query performance
SELECT 
    query,
    calls,
    total_time,
    mean_time,
    stddev_time,
    rows,
    100.0 * shared_blks_hit / nullif(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0) AS hit_percent
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check resource usage
SELECT 
    datname,
    numbackends,
    xact_commit,
    xact_rollback,
    blks_read,
    blks_hit,
    100.0 * blks_hit / (blks_hit + blks_read) AS hit_percent
FROM pg_stat_database
WHERE datname = current_database();

-- Check connection metrics
SELECT 
    state,
    COUNT(*) as connection_count,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (now() - backend_start))) as avg_connection_time
FROM pg_stat_activity
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY connection_count DESC;

-- Check lock metrics
SELECT 
    mode,
    COUNT(*) as lock_count
FROM pg_locks
GROUP BY mode
ORDER BY lock_count DESC;

-- Check cache metrics
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    heap_blks_read,
    heap_blks_hit,
    100.0 * heap_blks_hit / (heap_blks_hit + heap_blks_read) AS hit_percent
FROM pg_statio_user_tables
WHERE heap_blks_hit + heap_blks_read > 0
ORDER BY hit_percent ASC;
```

## 15.4 Log Analysis

Log analysis helps identify issues and optimize performance.

### Log Types:
- **Error Logs**: Error and warning messages
- **Query Logs**: SQL query logging

### Real-World Analogy:
Log analysis is like reviewing security camera footage:
- **Error Logs** = Security incidents
- **Query Logs** = Activity logs
- **Connection Logs** = Entry/exit logs
- **Checkpoint Logs** = System checkpoints
- **WAL Logs** = Change logs

### SQL Example - Log Analysis:
```sql

    name,
    setting,
    unit,
    context,
    short_desc
FROM pg_settings 
WHERE name IN (
    'log_destination',
    'logging_collector',
    'log_directory',
    'log_filename',
    'log_statement',
